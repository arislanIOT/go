Go needs to know the entry point of the language. 


> Go programs are organized as packages.

How do you know which function are in which package. 


Constants - variable value that cannot be changed/ alterterd

When we create vaiable or const and assign the value to it immedeitaly on the same line Go can undetstand the type of the variable. 

so for more robust 
define the variable type explecitly. 


%T is the place holder for the Type of the variable

%v is the place holder for the value of the variable. 

# Array
# Slice abstraction of the array
var var_name [size]var_type

# Loop in Go : How long the application should work.
